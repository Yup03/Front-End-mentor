## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I am experimenting `React` as a newbie, so i had to use a routing system build from scratch instead of `React Router` or `Nextjs`

### Continued development

I'll go over `React Router` and `Nextjs` in order to build more complex applications and to have more sophisticated routing System for my future projects
